# Dactyl-CC

I made a Dactyl build based on my Advantage360 that I had at work and couldn't afford to buy a second one for my home office at
the time. So I did the only logical thing and spent 3 months of my life prototyping the living heck out of dactyl keyboard to 
modify them for my needs until I came accross the configurator that I linked below. This tool is a life saver. Please consider 
supporting the maintainer if you can. This tool is quite versitile and allows for a simpler way to interact with these keyboard
builds.
